# CG-DEM-Wet-granular-systems
Relevant files for reproducing a base case simulation in the paper "A Coarse-Grained Discrete Element Model (CG-DEM) based on parameter scaling for dense wet granular system
", https://doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2024.120581.
The files include:
1)The modified version of the ViscoelasticCapillarPM.cpp and ViscoelasticCapillarPM.hpp scripts in Yade-DEM source code, which includes the modification in the liquid viscous force and the calculation of the capillary force at the contact of two wet particles. 
2)Python scripts for running simulations. 
3) Data from base simulations in dry, wet without liquid migration, and wet with liquid migration.
